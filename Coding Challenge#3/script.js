/*
Steven is still building his tip calculator, using the same rules as before: Tip 15% of the bill if the bill value is between 50 and 300, and if the value is different, the tip is 20%.

1. Write a function 'calcTip' that takes any bill value as an input and returns the corresponding tip, calculated based on the rules above (you can check out the code from first tip calculator challenge if you need to). Use the function type you like the most. Test the function using a bill value of 100.
2. And now let's use arrays! So create an array 'bills' containing the test data below.
3. Create an array 'tips' containing the tip value for each bill, calculated from the function you created before.
4. BONUS: Create an array 'total' containing the total values, so the bill + tip.

TEST DATA: 125, 555 and 44

HINT: Remember that an array needs a value in each position, and that value can actually be the returned value of a function! So you can just call a function as array values (so don't store the tip values in separate variables first, but right in the new array) ðŸ˜‰

GOOD LUCK ðŸ˜€
*/

function calcTip(bill) {
  return bill >= 50 && bill <= 300 ? bill * 0.15 : bill * 0.2;
}
console.log(calcTip(100));

const bills = [125, 555, 44];

const tips = [calcTip(bills[0]), calcTip(bills[1]), calcTip(bills[2])];
console.log(tips);

const total = [bills[0] + tips[0], bills[1] + tips[1], bills[2] + tips[2]];
console.log(total);

/*
Let's go back to Mark and John comparing their BMIs! This time, let's use objects to implement the calculations! Remember: BMI = mass / height ** 2 = mass / (height * height). (mass in kg and height in meter)

1. For each of them, create an object with properties for their full name, mass, and height (Mark Miller and John Smith)
2. Create a 'calcBMI' method on each object to calculate the BMI (the same method on both objects). Store the BMI value to a property, and also return it from the method.
3. Log to the console who has the higher BMI, together with the full name and the respective BMI. Example: "John Smith's BMI (28.3) is higher than Mark Miller's (23.9)!"

TEST DATA: Marks weights 78 kg and is 1.69 m tall. John weights 92 kg and is 1.95 m tall.

  fullName: "Mark Miller",
  mass: 78,
  height: 1.69,
  calcBMI: function () {
    return (this.BMI = this.mass / this.height ** 2);
  },
};
Mark.calcBMI(); //without this method call, Mark.BMI would not be available, because this method in the object properties doesn't call itself, we need to explicit call it
console.log(Mark.BMI);

const John = {
  fullName: "John Smith",
  mass: 92,
  height: 1.95,
  calcBMI: function () {
    return (this.BMI = this.mass / this.height ** 2);
  },

John.calcBMI();
console.log(John.BMI);

Exercise 3 : 
1.Add a method called 'describe' to the 'myCountry' object. This method will log a string to the console, similar to the string logged in the previous assignment, but this time using the 'this' keyword. 
2. Call the 'describe' method 
3. Add a method called 'checkIsland' to the 'myCountry' object. This method will set a new property on the object, called 'isIsland'. 'isIsland' will be true if there are no neighbouring countries, and false if there are. Use the ternary operator to set the property.

Exercise 4: 
There are elections in your country! In a small town, there are only 50 voters. Use a for loop to simulate the 50 people voting, by logging a string like this to the console (for numbers 1 to 50): 'Voter number 1 is currently voting
