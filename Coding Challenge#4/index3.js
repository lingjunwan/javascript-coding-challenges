/*
ClassList Practice
In index.html, you'll find 6 <li> elements, two of which have the 'highlight' class applied to them. 

Please use JavaScript and the classList property to invert which elements have the highlight class. 

Basically iterate over all the <li> elements and toggle the class of 'highlight' on each one.   Your end result should look like this:

Please don't touch the markup in index.html! Do this all via JavaScript!

const li = document.querySelectorAll("li");

li.forEach((element) => element.classList.toggle("highlight"));
