Sum Array Exercise
Write a function called sumArray which accepts a single argument: an array of numbers.  It should return the sum of all the numbers in the array.

sumArray([1,2,3]) // 6
sumArray([2,2,2,2]) // 8
sumArray([50,50,1]) // 101

Hints:
You'll need a variable to keep track of the total.  It should start out as zero.

Loop over the array and for each element, add it to the total variable.

After you have added every number to total, return total.

Please write a function called lastElement which accepts a single array argument.  The function should return the last element of the array (without removing the element).  If the array is empty, the function should return null.

lastElement([]) //null
